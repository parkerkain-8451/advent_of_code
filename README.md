# Advent of Code Challenges

This repo stores all of my Advent of Code Challenges going forward!

If you'd like to run my solutions, create a python venv and install the `requirements.txt` file from the respective year.

I really enjoy the Advent of Code CLI for making getting the inputs and reading the puzzles super pleasant from the terminal.
